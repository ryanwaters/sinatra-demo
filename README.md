sinatra-demo
============

Just about the first thing I ever coded, my first attempt at using an API. Simple search of the omdbapi for movies that displays the poster, description, title, year it came out, and the Rotten Tomatoes rating. Written in ruby. It even has one simple Rspec test written for it. I also added a Ryan Gosling theme, for the ladies.
